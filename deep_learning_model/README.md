### Abstract

In this chapter, we consider malware classification using deep learning techniques and image-based features. We employ a wide variety of deep learning techniques, including multilayer perceptrons (MLP), convolutional neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent units (GRU). Among our CNN experiments, transfer learning plays a prominent role—specifically, we test the VGG-19 and ResNet152 models. As compared to previous work, the results presented in this chapter are based on a larger and more diverse malware dataset, we consider a wider array of features, and we experiment with a much greater variety of learning techniques. Consequently, our results are the most comprehensive and complete that have yet been published.

### Quick Notes:

* Classic ML-based approaches tried : K-NN, Random Forest, and XGBoost
* Deep Learning-based approaches tried: ANN, CNN, LSTM, and GRU
* Implementation is using sklearn, numpy, pandas and pytorch.
* MS Windows executable binary files are used as data.
* Features
  * Classic ML-based approaches: PE fie features are extracted and used
  * Deep Learning-based approaches: (1) Opcodes (2) Converted executables into gray-scale images
* This project is an extension of https://github.com/pratikpv/malware_classification

### Steps to repro

# Packages requirements

* Install pefile pythong package e.g. `conda install pefile` 
* Install PyTorch and other libs e.g. `conda install -c pytorch torchtext`. All other common dependencies should be covered by anaconda distro.
* `objdump` in ubuntu. (This code is developed and tested for ubuntu-based development env)

# Malware samples

 * copy the malware samples at <project_dir>/data/exec_files/exec_files. You can reach out to me for samples used in this research. Overall directory structure should look like this,

# Data preprocessing

Execute `data_preprocess.py` with below mentioned options to preprocess the data.

`python data_preprocess.py --extract_pe_features`

`python data_preprocess.py --bin_to_img`

`python data_preprocess.py --extract_opcodes`

`python data_preprocess.py --split_opcodes`


# Train and test models
Execute `detect_malware.py` with appropriate command-line args for models to train/test. e.g.

`python detect_malware.py --deep_feedforward`

`python detect_malware.py --deep_rnn`

`python detect_malware.py --shallow_ml`

`python detect_malware.py --transfer_conv_ml`
